FIREWALL CONFIGURATION USING UFW ON KALI LINUX
================================================

# Update the package list to get the latest version of all repositories.
sudo apt update
-> Ensures your system knows about the latest available software updates and security patches.

# Install UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) if itâ€™s not already installed.
sudo apt install ufw -y
-> Downloads and installs UFW automatically without asking for confirmation (-y).

# Enable the firewall.
sudo ufw enable
-> Activates UFW so that it starts filtering network traffic based on its rules.

# Check the current firewall status and rules in a detailed view.
sudo ufw status verbose
-> Displays whether UFW is active, default policies, and any rules currently applied.

# Add a rule to block inbound TCP traffic on port 23 (Telnet).
sudo ufw deny 23/tcp
-> Denies any incoming connections using the TCP protocol on port 23.
-> Telnet (port 23) is insecure, so blocking it is a common security best practice.

# Display all the rules currently configured in UFW with numbering.
sudo ufw status numbered
-> Shows the list of active rules along with rule numbers, which help when deleting specific rules later.

# Test the Telnet block rule by trying to connect to port 23.
telnet localhost 23
-> Attempts to connect to the local machine on port 23.
-> If the rule is working, the connection will fail or be refused.

# Allow inbound TCP traffic on port 22 (SSH).
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
-> Allows secure shell (SSH) connections so you can remotely access your system safely.
-> Port 22 is the default SSH port.

# Display rules again to confirm that both allow (SSH) and deny (Telnet) rules are applied.
sudo ufw status numbered
-> Helps verify that rules are active and ordered correctly.

# Remove the deny rule for Telnet to restore normal settings.
sudo ufw delete deny 23/tcp
-> Deletes the specific rule that was blocking Telnet.
-> Alternatively, you can delete by rule number (see below).

# Delete a rule by its rule number (optional method).
sudo ufw delete [rule_number]
 -> Replace [rule_number] with the number shown in 'sudo ufw status numbered'.
-> Useful if multiple rules for the same port exist.

# Export current UFW configuration (for documentation).
sudo ufw status verbose > ufw-status.txt
-> Saves the full UFW rule set and status into a text file for your submission.

# Disable UFW (optional cleanup step).
sudo ufw disable
-> Turns off the firewall, reverting the system to an unfiltered state.
-> Useful after testing or before uninstalling UFW.
